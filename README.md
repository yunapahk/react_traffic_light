# Traffic Light

Objectives:

- Creating and nest Components
- Passing props and how to using them in JSX
- Importing and setting up state
- Updating state and re-rendering the Component

## Working Version

Here is a [working CodeSandBox solution](https://zhtbi.csb.app/) of the app so you can examine the components in React DevTools.

## Starter CodeSandbox

Here is our [Starter CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/traffic-light-single-app-component-starter-pqrpw)

### Instructions

With the starter data below and the working example, use dev tools to deconstruct how it was built and replicate in a fork of the starter sandbox.

Hints:
- Use React devtools to understand which components exist, their props, their state
- Use the elements tab of React Dev Tools to understand what the JSX for those components should look like.


```javascript
export default [
  {id: 'stop', name:'Stop', color: 'red'},
  {id: 'slow', name: 'Slow', color: 'yellow'},
  {id: 'go', name: 'Go', color: 'green'},
]
```
